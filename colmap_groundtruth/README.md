## AFRL Underwater Dataset

This folder contains COLMAP trajectories for underwater dataset discussed in the visual-inertial comparison paper. The dataset is available at [AFRL Underwater Dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14LEMMigHxHRGESOZNudUM4LuxXFGLVmE). Link to paper: [Experimental Comparison of Open Source Visual-Inertial-Based State Estimation Algorithms in the Underwater Domain](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8968049). arxiv link: [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.02215).

The COLMAP trajectories for Bus and Cemetry dataset are partial as it was not able to register all the images. The trajectories are correct upto scale only.

If you use the datasets, please cite the following paper:
